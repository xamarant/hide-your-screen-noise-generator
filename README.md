The circuit of the noise generator on the chip. It creates interference, makes it impossible to remotely restore the image from the computer screen by electromagnetic leakage from the video cable.

If the current flows through the wires with electrical signals, then these wires emit radio waves. On the radio waves from the video cable, intelligencer can restore the image on the computer screen, as well as pressed keys on the keyboard.

This information is usually used to spy on people and destroy their lives. To steal confidential information, passwords, program code and other secrets.

This simple radio noise generator creates interference by masking radio signals from the wires so that screen image can not be recovered.

The chip is made up of two halves. Therefore, two independent interference generators with mutually perpendicular antennas can be made from it.

Between 4 and 6, 13 and 11 pins of the chip, you need to connect a two-wire cable long enough. The wires play the role of a radiating antenna, and the insulation between the wires plays the role of a capacitor. The length of the wires should be no less than the length of the video cable, or at least 30 centimeters. One antenna should coiled around power supply cable, supplying the computer or laptop, and the second antenna should be placed near to the laptop or computer. It is best to power the jammer from one of the ports on the computer.

Microchip: 74LS04 or analogues
Input Voltage: 5-11 VDC
Current: 20-50 mA
Noise range: 10-460 Mhz

This is a low-power and low-cost noise generator, it does not interfere with the operation of television, radio and mobile networks. But its power is enough to prevent spying on the screen.
